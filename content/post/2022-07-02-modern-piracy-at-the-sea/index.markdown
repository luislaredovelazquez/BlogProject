Global piracy and armed robbery in the sea, is a huge concern for many governments and organizations. Only in 2021, the  <http://intercargo.org> organization reported 132 incidents against ships around the world. These events included:

- 115 vessels boarded
- 11 attempted attacks
- 5 vessels fired
- 1 vessel hijacked

This problem has been evolving through the years, to explain its magnitude I created a visualization <https://luislaredo.netlify.app/sea_piracy/finalversion/> which includes a comparison of the attacks longitude, latitude and its closer shore's coordinates. 

Also, I added an interactive table to see if there's a correlation between the most attacked countries and its crime rate. The dataset to create this visualization was taken from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/n0n5ense/global-maritime-pirate-attacks-19932020?select=pirate_attacks.csv> and was created using R, and Javascript.

Finally, in this post we can see that the overrall interest on this topic has increase for the past years, and that this subject stays relevant until this day. As an example, a few weeks ago, there was an attack on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico where criminals assaulted an oil station as we can see in this news <https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy78y7/gulf-of-mexico-pirates-pemex-oil-rig>

Nonetheless, when we look at Sea Attacks in Twitter, we find that people usually relates this term with the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine as we see in the following chart.

As a conclusion of this project, I realize that there's an essential need to increase the security in coasts all over the world as these are the main points where these kind of attacks are usually perpetrated Also, this will bring side benefits like a better control of immigrants coming to the coasts through the use of small boats in dangerous conditions.
