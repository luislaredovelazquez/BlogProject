I'm currently studying for a Master's degree in Computer Sciences focused on Human-Technology Interaction at Tampere University, FI. I enjoy learning new things, and the topics that interest me the most are DevOps, CyberSecurity, Data Science, and UX.

During this time, I have achieved significant experience working with multidisciplinary teams on projects ranging from technological implementations to strategic planning. I consider myself someone who likes to apply new things in his everyday life.
